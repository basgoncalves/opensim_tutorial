Step 3: Placing markers on model
Loaded marker file D:\3-PhD\Data\MocapData\ElaboratedData\009\pre\Scale\..\staticElaborations\static1.trc (67 markers, 1 frames)
Deleted 0 unused markers from model 009
Frame at (t=0):	total squared error = 0.0400709, marker error: RMS=0.0298407, max=0.123657 (T10)
Moved markers in model 009 to match locations in marker file D:\3-PhD\Data\MocapData\ElaboratedData\009\pre\Scale\..\staticElaborations\static1.trc
Wrote model file ..\009_Rajagopal2015_FAI.osim from model 009
Wrote marker file ..\staticElaborations\static_output.trc from model 009
