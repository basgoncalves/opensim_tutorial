Step 3: Placing markers on model
Loaded marker file E:\3-PhD\Data\MocapData\ElaboratedData\009\pre\Scale\../staticElaborations/static1.trc (67 markers, 571 frames)
Averaged frames from time 0.005 to 0.01 in E:\3-PhD\Data\MocapData\ElaboratedData\009\pre\Scale\../staticElaborations/static1.trc (frames 2 to 3)
Deleted 0 unused markers from model 009
Frame at (t=0):	total squared error = 0.040188, marker error: RMS=0.0298842, max=0.122414 (T10)
Moved markers in model 009 to match locations in marker file E:\3-PhD\Data\MocapData\ElaboratedData\009\pre\Scale\../staticElaborations/static1.trc
Wrote model file ../009_Rajagopal2015_FAI.osim from model 009
Wrote marker file ../staticElaborations/009_static_output.trc from model 009
